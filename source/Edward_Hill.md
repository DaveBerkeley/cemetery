"The area was first occupied in 1550 by the Portuguese, though in the 17th century Portuguese influence diminished. The area came under the control of Sweden in the 1650s, led by the Dutch trader Hendrik Carloff. In 1652, he was given permission to build a small fortified lodge by the King of Accra, with whom he had previously done business. In 1660, control passed to the Netherlands but it was soon lost to Denmark-Norway. "

The castle, now called Osu Castle, was originally built by the Danish in the 1660s. It was used as a base for the export of gold and ivory. Later it became a slaving base. The British bought Denmark's Gold Coast possesions in 1850.

In 1852 the British imposed a poll tax on the locals. In 1854 the steamer HMS Scourge shelled Accra as punishment,
