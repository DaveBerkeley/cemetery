PLYMOUTH - The Explosion At Plymouth. - Mr R. B. Johns, Borough Coroner, opened an Inquiry at the South Devon and East Cornwall Hospital yesterday, with reference to the deaths of WILLIAM PARSONS and JAMES COOK, killed by a dynamite explosion on Wednesday. Mr J. R. Pethick was present, and Mr J. W. Bickle represented deceased's relatives. The Corner explained that in all cases where dynamite was concerned, it was necessary to communicate not only with the local inspector of factories, but also with the Home-office in London. There had been no time for the inspector to get to Plymouth, and the Inquest would have to be adjourned. - William Radford, of the Royal Naval Ordnance, and foreman at Bull Point, said WILLIAM PARSONS was a labourer in the employ of Pethick Brothers. He was 55 years of age and resided at No. 19 William-street, Morice Town. - WALTER COOK identified his brother, and said they were both employed as labourers by Messrs. Pethick, and lived at 4 Queen-street, Devonport. Witness was present at the time of the explosion, but was not on the raft. The Inquest was then adjourned until Monday afternoon.

Western Morning News, Tuesday 19 December 1893 PLYMOUTH - Dynamite Explosion At Plymouth. The Adjourned Inquest. - The adjourned Inquiry respecting the deaths of WILLIAM PARSONS and JAMES COOK, killed by an explosion of dynamite on Wednesday last, at Sutton Pool, Plymouth, was resumed yesterday at Plymouth Guildhall. Mr J. D. Sowerby (Chief Constable) was present on behalf of the Police, Mr T. Percy Pearce (Bond, Pearce and Bickle) represented the relatives of the deceased, and Mr T. H. Geach for Messrs. Pethick Bros. The Coroner (Mr R. B. Johns) had procured good photographs of the pontoon upon which the explosion took place, and an empty charge case and fuse to assist the Jurymen. - Richard Stidston, diver in the employ of Messrs. Pethick, said he was working one of the tubes on the pontoon. He had set the charges and took his place at one of the winches. The pontoon was about 40 to 50 feet away from where the two charges were set. He heard two go off, and not hearing the third, said to COOK, "This one is gone out; I believe it is going to serve me a trick." COOK replied that there was smoke coming out of the pipe. It was a common occurrence for smoke to come out of the pipe after the fuse had been set. Whilst going to tell the men to heave the pontoon back further, for fear the charge was under the pontoon, the charge exploded. He heard COOK call out, "Come Dick, and catch me hold." He went to COOK'S help and took the scarf from his neck and bound it around COOK'S thigh which had been ripped open to the extent of about eight inches. He gave orders for the pontoon to be got near the pier, so that COOK could be got ashore. he saw two men bring PARSONS from behind a water tank wounded. COOK and PARSONS were taken to the Hospital. He had been working at this sort of work many years. He made the charges that particular day, and set them, but did not ram them down, two other men doing that and withdrawing the rod. He had never had an accident before. The accident, he believed, was due to the rod used for ramming the charge, catching the explosive tube and withdrawing it. He examined the raft the next day, but found no damage had been done to it. The holes bored were about six feet three inches deep. There were seven men working on the pontoon including himself, he being in charge. - In reply to Mr Pearce, he denied having had any conversation with the brothers of COOK. - Frank Mallett, labourer, in the employ of Messrs. Pethick, said it was his duty to press the charges home. He always assisted at the blasting operations. He had his back to the deceased COOK when the explosion took place, and was knocked down by the concussion. When he rose he heard COOK shouting out to Stidston, and he went to COOK'S assistance. He caught him as he was falling and lowered him to the deck. Deceased was bleeding from the thigh. He heard Stidston call to COOK to lower the tackles. COOK did not have the chance of lowering the pipe. Witness had been working for Messrs. Pethick for eighteen months, and had never known a similar explosion, nor the fuse become attached to the pipe. He did not notice anything unusual after withdrawing the pole from pressing the charge home. About ten minutes expired before the explosion, after he had finished pressing the charge. The pipes were drawn up level with the deck. - Richard Stidston, recalled, stated that the fuse burnt at the rate of one minute a yard, and there were seven yards of fuse on that particular day. - Samuel Jenkin, labourer, in the employ of Messrs. Pethick, said he helped Mallett to press down the charge. When the explosion took place he was at the back winch, waiting to go back after the charge had gone off. - WALTER COOK, of 12 King-street, Devonport, brother to the deceased, and in the employ of Pethick Brothers, said on the day of the explosion he was working near, and on hearing the explosion he ran to the pontoon, and there saw his brother lying down wounded. On the day following he and his brother saw Stidston on board the pontoon and had a conversation with him. Stidston said he was not positive how the accident occurred. Smoke, he continued, was reported coming up the tube, and he (Stidston) replied, "I hope this charge is not going to serve me a dog." The smoke went away and on reappearance, Stidston ordered the pipe to be lowered, but before it could be done the charge exploded. This conversation took place about eleven o'clock on Thursday morning. His brother had been in Mr Pethick's employ about nine months. - GILES GRIFFITHS COOK, labourer, of 3 Wyndham-street, W., Plymouth, corroborated his brother' s statement. - P.C. Burrows said the explosion was a very loud one. He immediately ran to the edge of the quay. Seeing what was the matter he immediately fetched a stretcher and an ambulance and took COOK and PARSONS to the S.D. and E.C. Hospital. - Reginald Newton Weekes, assistant House Surgeon at S.D. and E.C. Hospital, said COOK was suffering from shock and loss of blood. About six inches below the groin there was a small wound. Whilst his wound was being dressed he died, about fifteen minutes after admission. COOK said several times, "I am dying." It would be a good thing for a tourniquet to be kept with each ambulance. If one had been used in this case, soon after the accident, COOK'S life could have undoubtedly been saved. - Mr Sowerby (Chief Constable) said he intended to ask the Watch Committee on Wednesday next to allow him to go to the expense of supplying each ambulance with a tourniquet. - The case of PARSONS was next proceeded with. - The doctor stated that PARSONS was dead before he arrived at the Hospital. On examining the body he found a hole on the right side, between two ribs, through the right lung, and notching the top of the heart. A piece of iron was lodged between the heart and the left lung at the end of the tract. Death was due to rupture of the heart. - Richard Stidston said the inspector of explosives had been to Plymouth, examined the machinery on the pontoon and offered him a valuable suggestion which is being now carried out. - The Coroner said if the pipe had been lowered more smartly after smoke was seen issuing, the explosion would have taken place under water, and not have caused any serious damage. The inspector did not attribute any blame to the men, but only offered a suggestion. - The Jury returned a verdict of "Accidental Death," and hoped the Inspector's advice would be followed as to lighting the fuse at the bottom of the tube instead of at the top and complimented P.C. Burrows and Mr Hill for their smartness in conveying the wounded men to the Hospital.
