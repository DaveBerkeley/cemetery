The SS Rawalpindi was a converted former P&O cruise liner, an armed merchant cruiser. Captain Kennedy was father of the broadcaster Sir Ludovic Kennedy.

The Rawalpindi was sent an incorrect report of the sighting of German pocket-battleship Deutschland, but was in fact faced with the mighty German Battle-cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau which Grand Admiral Raeder had despatched two days earlier as a preliminary operation to give the two big ships some experience before letting them loose on the main trade routes.

Signalled by the German warships to heave to and abandon ship, Captain Kennedy chose instead to turn and engage the enemy warships. Long before the gallant Rawalpindi could get within range to use her elderly 6-inch guns, German shells, from the powerful 11-inch guns of the Scharnhorst, reduced her to a smashed and burning wreck. Within forty minutes the shattered vessel sank beneath the waves taking with her 265 brave men including her gallant Captain. The Gneisenau picked up twenty-one survivors, Scharnhorst another six, and on the following day HMS Chitral found eleven more.

Kennedy was heard to say "We'll fight them both, they'll sink us, and that will be that. Good-bye".
